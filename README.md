# Just Another Text Editor

## Description

This project takes the starter code for a text editor application with the goal of turning it into a PWA application. For the purposes of this project, I handled the webpack configuration, CRUD operations and installer event handlers in the JavaScript, and the scripts and dependencies in the package.json. This project allowed me to learn more in depth the work flow of PWA applications/projects.

The user may use the scripts found in the root folder package.json by running `npm run` followed by the corresponding script.
